# Train_delays_and_services

In this project I'm analysing train delays, cancellations, and unusual service patterns. The hypothetical stakeholders are Network Rail, train operators, station managers with a secondary stakeholder of passengers. 

The aims:

•	Predict if a train is likely to be late, and if so, how late
•	Predict if a train is likely to be cancelled
•	Look at unusual service patterns
